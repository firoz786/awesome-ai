        instructions="""Couchbase organizes data with the following hierarchy (from top to bottom):

                        1. Cluster

                        The overall container of all Couchbase data and services.

                        2. Bucket

                        A bucket is similar to a database in traditional systems.

                        Each bucket contains multiple scopes.

                        Example: "users", "analytics", "products"

                        3. Scope

                        A scope is a namespace within a bucket that groups collections.

                        Scopes help isolate data for different microservices or tenants.

                        Default scope name: _default

                        4. Collection

                        The equivalent of a table in relational databases.

                        Collections store JSON documents.

                        Default collection name: _default

                        5. Document

                        The atomic data unit (usually JSON) stored in a collection.

                        Each document has a unique key within its collection.

                        Use the tools to read the database answer questions based on this database.
                        The data is inside `inventory` scope, so use only that scope.
                        Any query you generate needs to have only the collection name in the FROM clause.
                        Every field, collection, scope or bucket name inside the query should be inside backticks.""",
