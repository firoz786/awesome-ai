# DSPy Starter Agent

A powerful AI agent built with DSPy, leveraging advanced LLMs and tool integration for reasoning, search, and computation. This starter project uses the Nebius AI model and DSPyâ€™s ReAct framework to answer complex questions and perform multi-step tasks.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **LLM-Powered Reasoning**: Uses Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct via Nebius AI for intelligent responses
- ðŸ§® **Tool Integration**: Access to Python interpreter and Wikipedia search for multi-step reasoning
- ðŸ”— **ReAct Framework**: Combines retrieval, action, and computation in a single agent
- âš¡ **Easy Customization**: Add your own tools and workflows
- ðŸ“Š **Structured Output**: Clear, interpretable answers

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Nebius API key (get it from [Nebius AI Studio](https://studio.nebius.ai/))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firoz786/awesome-ai-apps.git
cd starter_ai_agents/dspy_starter
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Nebius API key:

```
NEBIUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the DSPy agent:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

The agent will answer questions using Wikipedia search and Python math evaluation.

### Example Tasks

- "What is the population of France multiplied by the number of Nobel Prizes won by Marie Curie?"
- "Calculate the square root of the year the Eiffel Tower was built."
- "Find the capital of Japan and its population."
- "Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 and what was their age at the time?"

## Technical Details

The agent is built using:

- DSPy framework for LLM orchestration and tool use
- Nebius AI's Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model
- ReAct module for multi-step reasoning
- Python interpreter and Wikipedia search tools

### Workflow Structure

Tasks are processed by:

- Defining a question
- Using tools (search, math) as needed
- Returning a structured answer
