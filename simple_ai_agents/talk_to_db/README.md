## Architecture 🏗️

### Modular Design

- **UI Layer** (`app.py`): Streamlit interface and user interactions
- **Database Layer** (`database.py`): Connection management and query execution
- **AI Layer** (`ai_services.py`): Natural language processing and SQL generation

### Key Components

- **Connection String Parser**: Safely parses MySQL connection strings
- **SQL Translator**: Converts natural language to SQL using Nebius AI
- **Result Explainer**: Provides business insights from query results
- **Query History**: Tracks and displays previous queries

## Example Workflow 🔄

1. **Ask a Question**: "What are the top 5 most expensive products?"
2. **AI Generates SQL**: `SELECT id, name, price FROM product ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5`
3. **Review SQL**: Check the generated query before execution
4. **Execute Query**: Run the query and see results
5. **Get Explanation**: AI explains the results in plain English
6. **Save to History**: Query is saved for future reference
